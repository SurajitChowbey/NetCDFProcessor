# NetCDFProcessor
Java program to read a netCDF file (point cloud â€“ sample attached) and for a given center lat-lon and radius(mtr.) (user input; must be within the file read in) generate the following data:

b.                   Min, Max, Average, Median values of the heights of all points within the radius

c.                   Weighted average of the Altitude value of the points within the radius. Weight the closest points at 100%(user input) and furthest points at 50%(user input) with a linear distribution
